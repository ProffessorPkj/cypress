Test Plan

Registration of a Patient:

Verify that a new patient can successfully register on the portal.
Validate different registration scenarios (e.g., with valid data, with invalid data, with existing email/phone number).
Ensure proper validation messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
Check that after successful registration, the patient can log in with the registered credentials.
Login to the Portal by the Registered Patient:

Ensure that registered patients can log in using their credentials.

Verify login with correct credentials.
Validate login with incorrect credentials (invalid username, password).
Check for appropriate error messages on unsuccessful login attempts.
Verify the redirection to the Home Page or Dashboard after successful login.
Validation of User Information on Home Page and Account Section:

Upon successful login, verify that patient information (name, contact details) displayed on the Home Page matches the registered details.
Navigate to the Account section and validate that all registered user information (e.g., name, date of birth, contact information) is correctly displayed.
Ensure that sensitive information (like password or personal details) are appropriately masked or not displayed where necessary.
Adding a Driver's License by the Patient:

Navigate to the section where a patient can add their Driver's License information.
Verify that the patient can input and save details such as license number, issuing state, expiration date, etc.
Validate that the entered Driver's License information persists and displays correctly upon subsequent visits to the portal.
Ensure error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect format, missing fields).
